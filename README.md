# Grid Border Generator

## Overview

This project is an algorithm designed to generate borders between cells of differing values within a grid. The grid is constructed using arrays, where each array represents a row, and each element within these arrays represents an individual cell. The primary purpose of this algorithm is to evaluate adjacent cells within a large grid (e.g., 20x20 cells) and generate borders based on the values of these neighboring cells.

## Features

- **Dynamic Grid Construction**: The grid is constructed from arrays, making it easy to manipulate and evaluate cell values.
- **Border Generation**: The algorithm intelligently places borders between cells that contain different values, creating a clear visual separation on the grid.
- **Large Board Support**: Designed to handle large grids, such as 20x20 cells, efficiently.
- **Adjacency Evaluation**: The algorithm evaluates the values of adjacent cells and determines the necessary borders based on these evaluations.

## How It Works

1. **Grid Initialization**: The grid is initialized as an array of arrays, where each array represents a row of cells, and each element within these arrays represents a single cell.

2. **Value Assignment**: Each cell in the grid is assigned a value. These values can represent different types or states that require differentiation.

3. **Adjacency Evaluation**: The algorithm evaluates the values of each cell's adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).

4. **Border Generation**: Based on the evaluation, the algorithm determines where borders need to be placed. Borders are generated between cells with different values to create a clear distinction between them.

## Example

For a 20x20 grid where cells are either value `A` or `B`, the algorithm will:

- Evaluate each cell and its neighbors.
- Place borders between cells where one is `A` and the other is `B`.

## Usage

1. **Setup the Grid**: Define the grid size and populate it with initial values.
2. **Run the Algorithm**: Execute the algorithm to generate borders based on adjacent cell values.
3. **Output**: The grid will now have borders where necessary, creating a visually distinct separation between different cell values.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for more complex cell evaluations and border types.
- Optimization for even larger grids.
- Integration with graphical libraries for visual representation.
